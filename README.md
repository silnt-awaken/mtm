# 🎧 MTM – Music That Matters

**A platform that rewards real music engagement.**  
No bots. No fake streams. Just listeners that matter.

---

## 🚀 Why MTM?

Music has become saturated.  
Great tracks get buried. Fake streams win.

**MTM flips that.**

Inspired by [WAGUS](https://github.com/silnt-awaken/wagus_app), MTM is built on the same principles:
- ✅ Real users only
- ✅ On-chain rewards via SPL tokens
- ✅ A system designed to *filter* noise, not chase it

This isn't just a player. It’s a proof-of-listen protocol.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter** – Cross-platform frontend
- **Firebase** – Auth, Firestore, and analytics
- **Solana + SPL Tokens** – Listener rewards
- **Anti-Bot Verification** – Ensuring only real users benefit
